Subjective: I am experiencing a sore throat and some fever for the past three days.
Objective: To determine if there is a viral infection and to determine the appropriate course of treatment.
Assessment: Based on the patient's symptoms and history, it seems likely that they have a viral infection. The patient has a cough and it hurts a bit when they swallow, which could be due to inflammation caused by the virus.
Plan: The patient will need to rest, drink plenty of fluids, and take over-the-counter pain medication such as acetaminophen. They will also need to avoid close contact with anyone who is sick, especially those with respiratory infections. If the symptoms do not improve within a week, the doctor may recommend antibiotics. The patient and the doctor will discuss the patient's progress and make any necessary adjustments to their treatment plan.
